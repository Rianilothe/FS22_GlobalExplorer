# Greetings
This mod was created to help new and experienced FS22 modders easily explore the game's live data structures. I was actually building another mod but needed a better way to figure out the way the game mechanisms were working. Studying other mods helped a lot but eventually I hit the wall.  This mod has helped me figure stuff out and I hope it helps you too.<br>- Rianilothe

# FS22_GlobalExplorer
The GlobalExplorer mod for FS22 provides an in-game data browser.
- lists of known globals, history and favorites
- lists data element names, types, values
- tables types include element count and "name/type" if present
- global list may be expanded locally (see modSettings/FS22_GlobalExplorer/globals.xml dir)
